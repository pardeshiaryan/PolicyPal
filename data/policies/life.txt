A life insurance policy provides financial protection for your loved ones. By paying regular premiums, you keep the policy active. In case of your death, the insurance company pays a lump sum to your chosen beneficiaries or family members. Life insurance policies are generally divided into two main types: Pure Protection Plans and Savings Plans. 

Pure Protection Plan: Term insurance is a pure protection plan designed to secure your family's future. It offers a substantial payout to replace income and cover expenses such as debts or daily needs in the event of your untimely demise.  

Savings Plan: A savings plan provides dual benefits: life coverage and a disciplined way to save for major financial goals, like funding your children's higher education or purchasing a home.

1. Term Life Insurance: This type of policy provides a death benefit only if the policyholder passes away during the policy term. If they survive the term, no claim can be made, and the coverage ends without any payout. Additional coverage, like accidental death or critical illness benefits, can be added through riders.

2. TROP: This is a particular type of term life insurance that comes with the additional advantage of survival benefit where all premiums paid by the insured will be paid back with GST if the insured survives the entire policy term. 

3. Whole Life Insurance: This policy covers the policyholder until 100 years of age and ensures financial coverage throughout the policy term. 

4.  Endowment Policies: This type of insurance plan combines guaranteed returns and life coverage. This type of plan offers a lump sum payout on maturity and enables the nominee to make a death claim in the event of the policyholder’s untimely death. Some endowment plans also come with the benefit of a bonus over the policy coverage. 

5.  ULIP: Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) are wealth-building options that combine the benefits of investment and insurance. Policyholders can invest in different funds-such as equity, hybrid, or bonds, based on their risk appetite and enjoy market-linked returns. These plans come with a five-year lock-in period, offer loyalty additions, and provide features like partial withdrawals and fund switching.

6.  Money Bank Policies: This type of insurance plan offers a percentage of the assured sum of the policy at regular intervals and returns the remaining portion of the corpus along with a bonus if the policyholder survives the policy term. The entire sum assured will be returned in case of an unfortunate event before the policy term. The policy also offers maturity benefits with lump sum payments. 

7. Child Plan: Ensures financial security for the child by fulfilling the child’s future goals using the return on investment. These policies offer life cover to the nominee and fund the balance premium even in the absence of the policyholder. 

8.  Whole Life Policy: This type of insurance policy offers 99 years of coverage with family protection for an extended duration. This type of plan is best suited for policyholders with dependents and offers lifetime protection to the policyholder and their children.

9.  Pension or Retirement or Annuity Plans: This is a wealth-building plan for non-working years of the policyholder and offers financial protection to family members as well. This plan comes with various withdrawal options, such as a lump sum payment, regular income, or both. 

Some other types of Life Insurance policies also include: 

Children Life Insurance Policy: This plan is a combination of savings and investment plan specially designed to meet the financial needs of the children in the future. This plan comes with intermediate withdrawal or provision of withdrawal after the child reaches adulthood. 
 Group Life Insurance: This type of policy is offered by employers, banks, NGOs, non-banking financial institutions, professional groups, and microfinance organizations to their employees or members. It provides financial support to the employee’s family in case of their untimely death. Some group insurance plans also include coverage for critical illness, disability, and outstanding loans for borrowers.

How to Save Tax with Life Insurance in India?
Being insured in today’s times is of utmost importance, even if your partner is already covered. While it can’t ease emotional loss, it provides crucial financial support in difficult times. With many insurers offering various plans, it’s important to choose wisely and understand the tax benefits of the policy you select. 

Section 80C of the Income Tax Act Deduction: Section 80C of the Income Tax Act Deduction: If you are paying premiums for your life insurance policy—or for your spouse, children, or parents, you can claim a tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.

GST on Life Insurance Premium
Life insurance is not exempted from GST (Goods and Services Tax). The introduction of GST will have an impact on the life insurance industry. The insurance premiums will most likely increase from 15% to 18% in the insurance sector. If you are paying premiums for health, car, and life insurance, you will be affected heavily.

Life insurance premiums vary based on factors like age, health, and lifestyle. While even low premiums can offer good returns over time, not everyone qualifies for them. Some people pay less for the same coverage because their healthy habits reduce their risk, helping them secure lower premiums.
