Adequate Sum Insured: Opt for a policy with sufficient coverage, considering inflation and choosing a sum insured of at least Rs. 10 lakh, up to Rs. 1 crore.

How to Claim Health Insurance?
Health insurance policies offer the convenience of cashless treatment and expense reimbursement by the insurer. Claims can be filed based on the sum insured limit of the policy. There are two main types of claim processes: 

Health Reimbursement Claims: For treatments received at non-network hospitals, policyholders can claim reimbursement for the treatment costs. After undergoing treatment, settle the bill, gather all pertinent documents, and then file a claim with the insurer or Third-Party Administrator (TPA) for reimbursement. 
Cashless Claims: If treatment is obtained at a network hospital, policyholders are eligible for cashless treatment services. Upon completion of treatment, the insurance company directly settles the bill with the hospital. 
Claim procedures for both cashless and reimbursement claims can vary for planned and emergency hospitalisations: 

How to Claim a Health Insurance for Planned Hospitalisation?
Notify the insurer at least 48 hours before the treatment for planned hospitalisation. 
Upon receiving approval from the TPA, file reimbursement and cashless claims by submitting the claim form. 
Provide additional documents such as medical bills, reports, discharge summaries, etc. 
Once approved, the insurer reimburses the claim amount for reimbursement claims. 
For cashless claims, the insurer directly settles the hospital bill. 
How to Claim a Health Insurance for Emergency Hospitalisation?
Alert the insurer within 24 hours of hospitalisation for emergency cases. 
Present your health card at the hospital. 
Submit a pre-authorisation form for TPA approval in emergency cases to facilitate cashless claims. 
If approved, the insurer directly settles the claim with the network hospital. 
In case TPA approval isn't obtained, reimbursement can be filed subsequently. 
Provide all necessary documents like hospital bills, discharge summaries, etc. 
The claim amount will be disbursed to you.

How NRIs Can Get a GST Refund on Health Insurance Policies?

Ensure that the plan is eligible for GST refunds. To secure a Goods and Services Tax (GST) refund on health insurance policies as a Non-Resident Indian (NRI), follow these steps: 

Step 1: Make sure that the payment of health insurance premiums is done on an annual basis. 
Use funds from a Non-Resident External (NRE) Account for premium payments, demonstrating that the funds originate from external sources. 
Step 2: Gather essential documents, including standard KYC (Know Your Customer) documents. 
Depending on the insurer, additional documents may be required, such as a Tax Residency Certificate (TRC), International Address Proof, Passport, PAN Card, and a recent photograph.  
Step 3: Submit all the required documents to your chosen insurance provider for verification. 
Step 4: The insurance provider will verify the submitted documents and process the issuance of the policy. 
Step 5: The GST refund process typically takes around 15 days after the issuance of the policy. 
Step 6: During the policy acquisition process, select the GST refund option to ensure eligibility for the refund. Adhere to any specific requirements set by the insurance company regarding documentation and procedures for GST refund. 
What are the Benefits of Health Insurance?
  The following are the main benefits of being covered by a health insurance policy:  

1. Cashless Treatment: When you are covered under a health insurance policy, you can avail cashless treatments which essentially means that you can receive medical treatments without having to pay the hospital from your own pockets.

2. Cover for Pre & Post-Hospitalisation Expenses: Effective insurance policies offer coverage for pre- as well as post-hospitalisation expenses for a period of 60 days before and after an insured individual is hospitalised.

3. Transportation Expenses: In case you hold a health insurance policy and get hospitalised the plan will cover the costs incurred on using an ambulance to transport you from your home to the hospital or vice-versa.

4. Medical Check-ups: Most health insurance policies offer free health check-ups. However, most insurance companies only offer these check-ups for free depending on your No Claim Bonus.

5. No Claim Bonus: If you hold a health insurance policy and do not make any claims over the course of an entire policy year, you will be rewarded in the form of a No Claim Bonus.

6. Room Rent: In case you are hospitalised, you will have to incur costs on room rent. Having a health insurance policy will ensure that these costs are covered to a significant extent.

7. Tax Benefits: Tax advantages can also come from having health insurance. Under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, you are entitled to a tax deduction for the premium payments you make toward your health insurance plan. 

8. Online Purchasing Facility: You can now acquire a plan online without going to a health insurance company branch thanks to technological improvements. From the convenience of your home or workplace, you can accomplish this.

Is COVID-19 Treatment Covered by Your Health Insurance Policy?
Your existing health insurance policy includes coverage for the expenses related to COVID-19 treatment. Many health insurers and general insurance providers have introduced specific health insurance plans designed to cover medical costs associated with treating COVID-19. Following the guidelines set by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), two distinct standard health insurance products, namely the Corona Kavach policy and the Corona Rakshak policy, have been introduced. These are gaining popularity among individuals seeking coverage for COVID-related expenses. Let's explore these two COVID insurance offerings and their differences compared to basic health plans. 

Corona Kavach Policy: This indemnity-based health insurance plan provides coverage for COVID-related hospitalisation expenses, home treatment, and AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) treatment costs. Additionally, it covers expenses for masks, gloves, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. 
Corona Rakshak Policy: The Corona Rakshak policy operates on a benefit-based model, offering a lump sum payment for hospitalisation expenses (minimum of 72 hours) upon the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the policy's term. The policy term ranges from a minimum of 3.5 months to a maximum of 9.5 months. 
What are Some of the Myths about Health Insurance?
Before purchasing a health insurance policy, it's crucial to dispel certain myths and understand how these policies actually work. Here are several prevalent myths that many individuals have about health insurance: 

'I don't need medical insurance, I am healthy': Despite maintaining good health, unexpected situations such as seasonal illnesses, accidents, or diseases like dengue and malaria can arise at any time. Hospitalisation expenses can be substantial, making health insurance essential to cover such costs. 
'All medical expenses are covered by my health insurance': Health insurance plans have specific exclusions and limitations as per IRDAI regulations. It's important to review policy details and coverage terms thoroughly. The insurer will only reimburse expenses that fall within the policy's coverage and sum insured limit. 
'Declaration of pre-existing diseases': Transparently declaring pre-existing diseases in the proposal form is crucial. If you fail to provide accurate information, then it can lead to claim rejection and additional costs. 
'Smokers cannot buy a health insurance plan': Some health insurance companies provide coverage to smokers and alcohol consumers, though they may undergo stringent medical exams and pay higher premiums due to associated risks. 
'Medical insurance will only cover hospitalisation expenses': While many health insurance plans cover hospitalisation exceeding 24 hours, some also cover daycare procedures that do not require extended hospital stays, such as cataract surgery or varicose veins treatment. 
'I am covered under a corporate or group health insurance plan': Relying solely on an employer-provided group health insurance plan has limitations. Coverage might not extend to family members, the sum assured may be insufficient, and critical illnesses might not be covered. Additionally, post-retirement or job loss can lead to costly insurance gaps.
